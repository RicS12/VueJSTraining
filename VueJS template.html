    //Basically VueJS creates an instance, which creates a template, and based on the template it process the real code so that the HTML works as it should. When inspecting the HTML element Hello World, you don't see the {title}, but instead see <p>Hello World! </p>

    //We output a single property stored in the data field of our VueJS instance
    //You can perfectly execute a function too
    //With curly braces, you return somethind that can be parsed into a String
    //We have access not only to everything stored inside the data property, but also what's stored in the methods.
    //By using VueJS directives, if you use v-bind:'htmlattribute', you can bind the HTML attribute so that it uses the VueJS template dyncamically.
    //Directives are instruction you place in your code.
    //v-binds tells VueJS to bind something to the data which is stored in the VueJS instance.
    //by using v-once, all the content besides the element will be rendered only once, and will not be updated later on if is updated
    //v-html directive allows us to pass the name of the property which holds the html code. You have to be careful though when using this as it allows for cross-sites attacks
