        }
    });
    //Basically, methods always run and recalculate, but computed properties are smart enough to know when they should or shouldn't run. In the case above, when hitting increase button, it calls both result() and output because they both check for this.counter, but when hitting Increase Second button, only result() is being called because output is smart enough to know that the property that is checking is this.counter, but the one updating is second counter, which means that it doesn't run and this can relief the burden on applications .
